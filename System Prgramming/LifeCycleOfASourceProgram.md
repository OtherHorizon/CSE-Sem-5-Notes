# Life Cycle Of A Source Program

The life cycle of a source program defines the Program Behavior and extends to execution stage, which exhibits the behavior specified in the program. Every source program goes through a life cycle of several stages.

## _Different Stages_

- `Edit Time`: It is the phase where the editing of the program code takes place and is also known as design time. At this stage the code is in its raw form and may not be in its consistent state
- `Compile Time`: At the compile time stage the source code after editing is passed to a translator that translates it into machine code. One such translator is a compiler. This stage checks the program for inconsistencies and errors and produces its executable file.
- `Installation Time`: Typically a program goes through the installation process.
