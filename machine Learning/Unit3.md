# Aspect of Clustering
- A clustering algorithm such as
    - partitional clustering eg, kmeans
    - Hierarchical clustering eg, AHC
    - Mixture of Gaussians
- A distance or similarity function
    - such as Euclidean, Minkowski, cosine
- Clustering quality
    - Inter-cluster distance => maximized
    - Intra-cluster distance => minimized

> The quality of a clustering result depends on the algorithm, the distance function, and the application  

# Major clustering Approaches
- <u>Partitioning</u>: Construct various partitions and then evaluate them by some criterion
- <u>Hierechical</u>: Created a hierarchial decomposition of the set of object using some criterion
- <u>Model-based</u>: Hypothesize a model for each cluster and find best fit of models to data
- <u>Density-based</u>: Guided by connectivity and density functions
- <u>Graph-Theoretic</u> clustering
> All model based clustering are semi-supervised
