# Fundamentaks of Machine Learning

## _Types of ML_

* Supervised Learning
    * X,y(pre-classified training example)
    * Given an observation x, What is the best label for y?
* Unsupervised Learning
    * X
    * Given a set of x's, ckuster or summarize them
* Semi-supervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
    * Determine what to do based on rewards and punishments.

## Data exploration

* data 
* dataset
* bigdata

> Bigdata -> volume - velocity - variety  

### <u>Types of data</u>
1. Qualitative Data 
    * It is data that uses words and descriptions
1. Quantative Data
    * It is data that is expressed in numbers
