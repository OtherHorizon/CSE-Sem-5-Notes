Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. Data encapsulation and data hiding fall under the category of Object Oriented Programming. Technically, in encapsulation the variable or data of a class is hidden from any other classes and can be accessed only through any member function of its own class in which it is declared.

## _Data hiding has many uses_

- Security purpose and data protection from misuse and unauthorized access.
- Hiding the physical storage layout  

    >"Data hiding is usually used or executed on volatile and sensitive data"

## _Difference between the two_

1. Data encapsulation is a process while data hiding is both process and technique
1. The data in data encapsulation is either public or private while the data in data hiding is private or non accessible
1. Data encapsulation is on the data inside the capsule while data hiding is concerned with restriction in terms of access and use.
