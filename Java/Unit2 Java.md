# Wrapper class
The wrapper class provide the mechanism to wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.  
Wrapper class a way to use premitive datatype(int, bool, etc.) as object.  
Auto boxing and unboxing feature convert premetive into object and object into premitive automatically. The automatic conversion of premitive into an object is known as Auto-boxing and vice versa unboxing.  
> "Wrapper class will convert premitive data type into object. The object is needed to support synchronization in multi-threading"

Example: 

1. 
```java
class wrapper{
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // creates objects of wrapper class
    Integer aObj = Integer.valueOf(23);
    Double bObj = Double.valueOf(5.55);

    // converts into primitive types
    int a = aObj.intValue();
    double b = bObj.doubleValue();

    System.out.println("The value of a: " + a);
    System.out.println("The value of b: " + b);
  }
}
```  
2. 
```java
//Java program to convert primitive into objects 
//Autoboxing example of int to Integer
public class WrapperExample1{
public static void main(String args[]){
//Converting int into Integer
intÂ a=20;
Integer i=Integer.valueOf(a);//converting int into Integer explicitly 
Integer j=a;//autoboxing, now compiler will write Integer.valueOf(a) internally

System.out.println(a+" "+i+" "+j);
}}
```

# Threading
Thread allow a program to operate more efficiently by doing mutliple things at the same time. We can define thread as a sub process with light weight with the samllest unit of the process and also has a separate path of execution. A traditional process has a single thread ,if a process has a multiple threads it can perfome more than a single task at a time

# Multithreading
Multithreading is a java process that allow concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of memory
- Multi threading save time as you can perform multiple operation together
- The threads are independednt, so it doesn't block the user to perform multiple operation at the same time
-  threads can be created by using two mechanism  
    - extending the first class, second implementing the runable class
